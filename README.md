# Belly-button-challenge
In this challenge I have - 
-Used the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://static.bc-edx.com/data/dl-1-2/m14/lms/starter/samples.json.
-Created a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
-Created a bubble chart that displays each sample.
-Displayed the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.
-Displayed each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
-Updated all the plots when a new sample is selected.
-Deployed app to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.
